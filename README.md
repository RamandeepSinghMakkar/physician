## **1️⃣ Medical NLP Summarization**

**Task:** Implement an NLP pipeline to **extract medical details** from the transcribed conversation.

- **NER:** Implemented using **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite** for highly accurate extraction.
- **Keyword Extraction:** Done using **spaCy** and **KeyBERT** (sentence-transformers model used).
- **Summarization:** Done using **BART (facebook/bart-large-cnn)** Transformer-based summarization.

```bash
Suppose for given text:
Patient – Good afternoon, Doctor.
Doctor – Good afternoon Rahul. How can I assist you today?
Patient – I have been feeling constantly thirsty and tired recently. I also noticed that I have been losing weight without any effort.
Doctor – I see. Let's run some tests to find out what's going on. It could be diabetes, but we need to confirm it.
Patient – I understand, doctor. I'll await the test results.
Doctor – Good. In the meantime, try to eat a balanced diet and get regular exercise. These are good practices whether you have diabetes or not.
Patient – I will do my best, doctor. Thank you.
Doctor – You're welcome. Take care.

### QUES-1 **How would you handle ambiguous or missing medical data in the transcript?**

We handle ambiguous or missing medical data in multiple ways:

1) **LLM Function Calling:**  
By using **Gemini models with structured output**, we allow the model to reason and return structured outputs even with partial or incomplete information. If any field is missing, we receive empty fields through our defined function structure.
2) **Post-Processing:**  
In our code, we use normalization functions like `normalize_ner_structure()` and `empty_ner_structure()` to handle cases where the API may return incomplete or malformed data.
3) **Few-shot learning capability of LLM:**  
Large models like **Gemini 1.5 Flash** can infer contextually missing data based on overall conversation, improving robustness.
4) **Default fallback structure:**  
We return consistent empty data structures for missing fields, ensuring downstream processes don’t fail.

### QUES-2 **What pre-trained NLP models would you use for medical summarization?**

In this project, we used:

1) **facebook/bart-large-cnn** — for medical text summarization using HuggingFace `transformers` pipeline.  
2) **sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2** — indirectly used for keyword extraction via KeyBERT.

## **2️⃣ Sentiment & Intent Analysis**

**Task:** Implement sentiment analysis to detect patient concerns and reassurance needs.

- **Sentiment Classification:** We used **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite** to classify into **Anxious, Neutral, Reassured**.
- **Intent Detection:** Extracted detailed patient intent via **Gemini structured output**.

### QUES-1 **How would you fine-tune BERT for medical sentiment detection?**

We could fine-tune **bert-base-uncased** (or preferably **BioBERT**) as follows:

1) **Collect domain-specific dataset:**  
Gather annotated patient-doctor conversations with labeled sentiment (Anxious, Neutral, Reassured) and intent (Seeking reassurance, etc.).
2) **Training:**  
- Fine-tune BERT with a classification head for multi-class sentiment and intent classification.
- Use cross-entropy loss.
- Set early stopping to avoid overfitting due to small medical datasets.
3) **Deployment:**  
Export fine-tuned model and serve via HuggingFace or Torch pipelines.

---

### QUES-2 **What datasets would you use for training a healthcare-specific sentiment model?**

Recommended datasets:

1) **MTSamples:**  
A collection of thousands of medical transcription samples.
2) **i2b2/UTHealth shared tasks datasets:**  
Contains de-identified clinical narratives and annotations.
3) **n2c2 clinical NLP challenge datasets:**  
Well-annotated clinical datasets often used in academia.
4) **MIMIC-III or MIMIC-IV:**  
Large publicly available de-identified ICU datasets from MIT.
5) **MedDialog Dataset (for patient-doctor dialogues):**  
Very helpful for intent and sentiment extraction from real dialogues.

## **3️⃣ SOAP Note Generation (Bonus)**

**Task:** Implement an AI model that converts transcribed text into a structured **SOAP note format**.

- Full structured SOAP generation using **Gemini 1.5 Flash**.
- Logical mappings into **Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan** implemented using the returned function call output.

### QUES-1 **How would you train an NLP model to map medical transcripts into SOAP format?**

There are two possible approaches:

#### **Approach 1: Fine-tuning Large LLM (e.g., GPT or LLaMA)**
- Collect large annotated datasets with conversation transcripts mapped into SOAP sections.
- Fine-tune an LLM (like **Llama-3** or **GPT-4**) via supervised learning on these mappings.
- This helps the model learn how to segment conversation flow into **Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan**.

#### **Approach 2: Rule-based + Prompt Engineering (our current solution)**
- Use few-shot prompting with **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite**.
- Provide explicit function calling with predefined JSON schemas.
- Allow the model to structure output directly into SOAP format even without fine-tuning.

### QUES-2 **What rule-based or deep-learning techniques would improve the accuracy of SOAP note generation?**

1) **Rule-based Improvements:**
- Use regex-based entity extraction for certain fields (e.g., lab values, dates).
- Use pre-trained clinical concept extractors (e.g., **MetaMap**, **QuickUMLS**).
- Incorporate sentence segmentation using **spaCy** for better context isolation.

2) **Deep Learning Improvements:**
- Use **ClinicalBERT** or **BioBERT** fine-tuned for SOAP generation tasks.
- Apply **Seq2Seq models (T5, BART)** fine-tuned on annotated SOAP note datasets.
- Incorporate **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)** to guide LLM output quality.
- Use **Chain-of-Thought prompting** to improve reasoning during complex SOAP mappings.
